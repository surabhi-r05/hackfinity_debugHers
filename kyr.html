            <h2>Rights of Working Mothers under the Maternity Benefit Act</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Maternity Benefit Act, 1961</strong>, grants a wide range of rights to working mothers in India, ensuring that they can take time off work to care for themselves and their newborns without fear of losing their jobs or financial stability. Below are the key rights guaranteed under the Act:</p>

            <h3>Maternity Leave</h3>
            <p>The Act entitles women to 26 weeks of maternity leave, of which no more than 8 weeks can be taken before delivery.</p>

            <h3>Eligibility for Maternity Leave</h3>
            <p>To qualify, a woman must have worked for her employer for at least 80 days in the 12 months before her expected delivery date.</p>

            <h3>Leave for Miscarriage or Medical Termination of Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>The Act allows six weeks of paid leave in case of miscarriage or medical termination of pregnancy.</p>

            <h3>Leave for Illness Arising from Pregnancy or Delivery</h3>
            <p>One month of paid leave is provided for illness arising from pregnancy or childbirth.</p>

            <h3>Adoption and Surrogacy Leave</h3>
            <p>The Act grants 12 weeks of paid leave for adoptive mothers and commissioning mothers (those using surrogacy).</p>

            <h3>Tubectomy Leave</h3>
            <p>Women who undergo tubectomy are entitled to two weeks of paid leave.</p>

            <h3>Medical Bonus and Healthcare Incentives</h3>
            <p>Women are entitled to a medical bonus of INR 3,500 if no free medical care is provided by the employer. The National Food Security Act provides additional benefits.</p>

            <h3>Crèche Facilities</h3>
            <p>Establishments with 50 or more employees must provide crèche facilities within a certain radius of the workplace.</p>

            <h3>Option to Work from Home</h3>
            <p>Female employees may be allowed to work from home after childbirth, provided the nature of the work permits it.</p>

            <h3>Protection from Termination</h3>
            <p>The Act prohibits termination of employment during maternity leave. Any termination is presumed to be due to pregnancy unless proven otherwise.</p>

            <h3>Prohibition of Hazardous Work</h3>
            <p>Pregnant women are prohibited from hazardous work that could affect their health or the health of their child.</p>
